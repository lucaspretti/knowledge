# [Telegram](https://telegram.org)

Telegram is by far the best messenger that exists right now.

I created a few public Telegram groups that I often contribute to. [macOS/iOS Automation](https://t.me/macOSautomation) being the biggest one.

I mapped my most visited chats with KM macros that call URL schemes like so:

This lets me jump between many groups in under 1 second time. For other groups I use the channel switcher.

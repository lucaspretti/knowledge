# [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

Don't write a lot of Java but the IDE is amazing.

I use [IdeaVim plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/164-ideavim), [Monokai Theme](https://darekkay.com/blog/monokai-theme-intellij/) and [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) as my font.

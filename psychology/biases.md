# Biases

- [Dunning–Kruger effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning–Kruger_effect) - The less you know about something, the more likely you are to think there isn't much to know about it.
- [Negativity bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias) - Notion that, even when of equal intensity, things of a more negative nature (e.g. unpleasant thoughts, emotions, or social interactions; harmful/traumatic events) have a greater effect on one's psychological state and processes than neutral or positive things.
  - In theory it protects you to from forgetting things that could harm you, and helps you notice potentially dangerous situations

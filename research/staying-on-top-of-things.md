# Staying on top of things

There is so much out there in the world. It's often hard to stay on top of things and many times not being able to understand something is frustrating so is feeling as if you are _missing out_.

Of course, it is all in my head and [mindfulness](../mindfulness/mindfulness.md) is the answer. But I still want to do my best and try and understand as many things as I can because knowing a broad range of things helps me connect the dots and pieces together faster.

I use [Focus](https://heyfocus.com) macOS app to completely block many websites with constantly updated feeds like front page of Hacker News, GitHub, Reddit and more. I automatically run Focus every 90 minutes for 80 minutes and work throughout this period fully focused. After that time, I review what I have done in [Timing](../macOS/apps/timing.md) and I have 10 minutes to check the news and view usually blocked websites and after that, the timer starts again.

On the phone I use [Telegram](https://telegram.org)'s saved messages feature as a way to send myself messages/links to view later on my mac or just for memory sake. I treat it as an Inbox of things similar to 2Do that I often try to go and clear through.

## What I use

I try to stay in touch using these few things:

### RSS with [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/mac/)

I follow [blogs I like](blogs.md) and read them through them with Reeder.

### [Hacker News](https://hckrnews.com/) and [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/)

They are my two favorite news aggregators on the web. I like Lobsters for its smaller community and quite often better links and discussions.

### Twitter with [Tweetbot](../macOS/apps/tweetbot.md)

Twitter is my favorite social media network and it is where I share everything [I am personally up to](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev) right now. I love Twitter for its ability to tailor completely what news and tweets I am actually reading. I never check the official Twitter page. I only view [the lists I made](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev/lists). I split my Tweetbot into [four columns](../macOS/apps/tweetbot.md) and the app is always full screen although during **Focus** session, the app is inaccessible to me, I can only post tweets.

### Reddit

My Reddit is heavily tailored to my own likes and I very often just look into some subreddits I like to see what is new. I list subreddits I like [here](https://github.com/learn-anything/reddit#readme).

I access all these subreddits from [Alfred Learn Anything](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-learn-anything#readme) and [Deanishe's Reddit worklfow](https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-reddit#readme) workflows.

### IRC

I love using IRC with [Textual client](../macOS/apps/textual.md) and hanging out in various channels of Freenode. Mostly as a way to get help with an issue that I can't solve on my own after searching for everything.

### [Pinboard (popular)](https://pinboard.in/popular/)

I sometimes check it out as it does contain some interesting links.

### Medium

I follow few publications and writers on Medium. I then view new articles from my feed [here](https://medium.com/stream/network).

### Communities and forums I frequent

I spend a lot of my time on [LA Discord server](https://discord.gg/KKYdWjt) to discuss LA development. As well as [macOS/iOS automation Telegram group](https://t.me/macOSautomation).

## Notes

- Best time to post links (HN especially) is somewhere around 16:30 CEST so it falls nicely in both EU & NA timezones

## Links

- [News](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/news-d6bcaaf40121) - I wrote briefly my opinion about consuming news and media. Although my opinion as stated in the article is still the same. My approach as indicated above has changed and hopefully became a bit more refined to meet my own goals.

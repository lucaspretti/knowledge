# Books

I love reading new books and making notes on things I've read and learned.

I keep a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/MOrnm2aN) of books I am reading and want to read. And I keep a few bookshelves of books I liked on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15768482-nikita-voloboev)

Below are books I read sorted by year I read them in. The books with links attached will lead to notes I made when reading the book. Books with ðŸŒŸ are my favorite.

# [IRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat)

I spend quite a lot of my time on [Freenode](https://freenode.net/) as it has so many useful channels and people that can help you.

I use [Textual](https://www.codeux.com/textual/ "Textual") IRC client and I use [ZNC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZNC) network bouncer to always keep me logged in to the servers as well as it keeping history logs when I am away.

Here are the IRC channels I often frequent:

## IRC commands

Textual keeps a command reference [here](https://help.codeux.com/textual/Command-Reference.kb).

- `/list` - Open channel list.
- `/msg *nickserv set <yourNSpassword>` - Lets Nickserv autologin you. Can then run `/nick <your-nick>` to login.

## Notes

- If I ever get issues with logging in and me being Guest. I can:

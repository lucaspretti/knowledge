# Design

> Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.

I can't call myself a designer yet but I am learning.

I do think design applies to everything I am doing. Even this wiki has some _design choices_ of how it can be structured. As the quote above says, it's not _how it looks like_, it's _how it works_.

Thus I try to be conscious of how my design decisions affect what I do. I like to use [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com) and [Figma](https://www.figma.com) when designing things.

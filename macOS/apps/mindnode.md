# [MindNode](https://mindnode.com/)

An application which allowed me to originally create all of the maps for [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz).

I also use MindNode to visualize topics and their relations as an [interactive mind map](https://my.mindnode.com/dPmKpWZgTpZsaG4Rf1yaz7rXbYhnuqPDDpdss4w2#1594.8,-1084.6,1). I use [Monokai Night](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os/tree/master/mindnode#readme) theme for it.

# [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com)

Day One is my digital life journal.

My entire life's experiences lives encrypted in the journal. Adding photographs I made and the thoughts and events that happened to me.

I document and review [my life](../../looking-back/looking-back.md) publicly too.

The app has integration with [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/day_one) which I use to automatically log all [my tweets](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev) and [Instagram posts](https://www.instagram.com/nikitavoloboev/).

If you don't journal, I suggest you to start, it is a very powerful mind cleanser and acts as a wonderful history record of your life.

I started with journaling by writing [Day Evaluations](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/day-evaluations-5706f31c9c5e#.m4lw1eo32), evaluating my day and noting interesting and memorable things that have happened to me during the day.

Since then however, I adopted a more open approach to documenting my memories and life in a way that doesn't stop me from being in the moment and just enjoying things and experiences.

I am very open to the public sharing both the things I know and like and also the different little things that happen to me, so I use [IFTTT](../../tools/ifttt.md) to log and archive my public activity from Instagram and Twitter into Day One.

## My Journals

### Life

Private observations & memorable experiences.

### Travel

Private travel notes. I post most everything on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nikitavoloboev/).

### Dreams

My dream journal. I want to lucid dream and to do that you need to remember your dreams. You also need to get into the habit of making reality checks. I note down memorable dreams I had briefly in this journal paying attention to common themes across all my dreams, if any.

### Family

Contains all the memories I shared with my family.

### Twitter

I use [IFTTT](../../tools/ifttt.md) to [automatically post all my tweets](https://ifttt.com/applets/56660889d-save-your-tweets-to-day-one) from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev) here. As I try lead a more open life, I often post in public outlets and share my experiences there so I want to have those experiences in Day One together with my more private memories.

### Instagram

Similar to Twitter, [this IFTTT recipe](https://ifttt.com/applets/61918118d-save-your-instagram-photos-to-day-one) will do the same but for my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nikitavoloboev/) photographs.

## Looking back

Besides Day One, I lead a more open diary and monthly overviews in [Looking back](../../looking-back/looking-back.md).

# [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/)

Keyboard Maestro is essentially an IDE for automation. You create macros of actions that you can then easily call from Karabiner.

It has a [wonderful community](https://forum.keyboardmaestro.com/) that is happy to help with whatever you are trying to achieve.

I share [all the macros I use](km-macros.md) with the app.

## Notes

- It is always better to run compiled AppleScripts.
- [Assert action](https://forum.keyboardmaestro.com/t/assert-action/8374). "If not condition, then fail". Useful for checking if you got right kind of data.
- You need to [set ENV_PATH variable](https://forum.keyboardmaestro.com/t/create-a-path-environment-variable-for-keyboard-maestro-and-add-usr-local-bin-to-the-default-path/10064) to make sure all your shell tools work in KM.
- You can read the full text of any error message in the Engine.log file (Help âž¤ Open Logs Folder), and make sure (at least when testing or having problems) that the Execute Shell Script is configured to display the result in a window so you can see any error message.
- [Keyboard Maestro converts any variables that start with ENV_ into environment variables when it launches sub-processes.](https://forum.keyboardmaestro.com/t/how-to-sent-env-in-keyboard-maestro/11947/2)

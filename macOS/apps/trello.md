# [Trello](https://trello.com)

I use the app a lot to track various ongoing things I have in my life.

I share many boards I have [publicly](../../sharing/my-trello.md).

I assign myself to the cards I am working on now and filter to see only them by [pressing Q key](https://trello.com/shortcuts). I mark cards I want to work on next with `Next` tag.

All of my boards are filtered to show only the cards I am assigned to.

## Notes

- You can attach link to card by simply selecting card and pressing `⌘ + V`.
  - You can also add a link as a new card itself by simply `⌘ + V`ing in the new card area. This will also fetch the thumbnail and add that to the card and create an appropriate title.
- In the date picker you can just type the number of the month to pick it. Or you can do `13/3` to make a due date for this year on March 13th.

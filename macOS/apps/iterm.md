# [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/)

Use Zsh as my shell together with [Antibody](https://github.com/getantibody/antibody) plugin manager and [Pure](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure) theme.

Assigned w + j with [Karabiner](karabiner/karabiner.md) to open the app from Keyboard Maestro in seconds.

I made my own [Monokai Night theme](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os/tree/master/iterm#readme) for it.

## My workflow

I always have at least 3 tabs (sessions) always open in iTerm. I open other tabs as the need arises and I start working on other projects.

My always open tabs are:

1. `jump` - This tab is where the majority of my work is done or when I need to quickly jump around my file system. Bound to `f+j`.
2. `kar` - Contains my [Karabiner configuration](karabiner/karabiner.md) I edit. Bound to `f+.`.
3. `vim` - Contains my [Vim config](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/dotfiles/blob/master/nvim/init.vim).

All other tabs are added on top of this `default` configuration. I use [this workflow](https://github.com/isometry/alfred-tty) to quickly switch between active tty sessions:

I use VS Code's integrated terminal when working on various code projects.

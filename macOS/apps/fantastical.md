I use the app to manage events in my life. I sync all events with Google Calendar and I sync many of [my Trello boards](../../sharing/my-trello.md) deadlines with iCal.

I use Fantastical's natural language input together with [many Typinator expansions](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/fantastical-natural-input-text-expansions-3ea8cf7ccac3#.pv5937ncr) to make new events in seconds.

I always view my events from `Week` view. And show 5 days only with all 24h shown for all days. This lets me have a perspective over what I have to do know. What deadlines I have to complete soon. And gives my the freedom to adjust my schedule in light of upcoming deadlines and events.

I use [KM macro](keyboard-maestro/km-macros.md) that when going to `Month` view, will hide away my `Routine` calendar so I can only see events that matter to me and get a quick glimpse of what deadlines and events are going on in my life and when.

And I often use all day events as a way to set deadlines for myself. I then plan events for the day(s) in accordance to my [Focus board](../../focusing/focusing.md) & deadlines I have.

## Notes

- To mass delete events, make empty search query (single space) on events I want to remove and delete them. Can also use stock Calendar app and search for `""` and cmd+shift+arrows events I want to delete.
- [Google calendar sync select page](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/syncselect) allows you to select which calendars you want to sync to external apps like Fantastical. Useful for letting Fantastical know about `Other calendars` which by default don't sync.

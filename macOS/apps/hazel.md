# [Hazel](https://www.noodlesoft.com)

I share all my Hazel rules and how I use them [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os/tree/master/hazel#readme).

## Notes

- If you want to have your rules to be applied onto subfolders as well as the directory chosen, add this rule.

- If extensions are hidden, don't add extensions in the rule editor too.

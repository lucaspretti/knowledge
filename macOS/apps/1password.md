# [1Password](https://1password.com)

Generate all of my passwords with it and keep everything in a secured and encrypted vault kept secure by my one master password.

No longer need to remember passwords and I now have a unique password for every website that I am signed up on whilst [activating two factor authentication](https://support.1password.com/one-time-passwords/) wherever possible.

As I use [SSO](https://auth0.com/blog/what-is-and-how-does-single-sign-on-work/) with either Google, GitHub or Facebook where possible I add it to the names of logins as such:

Where `(G)` stands for Google. Alternatively it could be `(H)` for GitHub and `(F)` for Facebook. Facebook is good for times when a service does need to hook into my friend circle (Spotify is good example of it).

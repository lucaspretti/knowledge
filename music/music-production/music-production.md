# Music production

Learning to write music. Live coding music sounds pretty awesome. I used [Sonic Pi](https://github.com/samaaron/sonic-pi) for a bit and it was fun.

## Tools

- [Klangmeister](http://ctford.github.io/klangmeister/about)
- [Ableton](ableton.md)
- [Helio Workstation](https://github.com/helio-fm/helio-workstation) - One music sequencer for all major platforms, both desktop and mobile.
- [Sonic Pi](https://github.com/samaaron/sonic-pi)
- [FlowKey](https://www.flowkey.com) - Learn Piano with songs you love.
- [Orca](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Orca) - Live Programming Environment. Each letter of the alphabet is an operation.

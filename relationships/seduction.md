# Seduction

One of the most valuable books I read on the topic of dating and relationships is [Models](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12633800-models). It states that the most important thing in any kind of relationship is honesty. In regards to seduction it is being honest with your intentions. The other important thing is being independent. It is usually the case that the person who feels most insecure in the relationship is at a disadvantage. In this position, it is thus much harder to be yourself as you will always be reliant on someone's thoughts or feelings. It is much better to simply be yourself and understand that whatever thoughts or feelings the person has are of their own making. And it is their opinion only which in no way reflects who you are and what you think of yourself.

Being honest with your intentions and being independent of anything brings confidence. The hardest part in doing anything in life including approaching new people on the street to simply say hi is the feeling of being rejected. This fear however is irrational. The worst thing that can happen is that you will indeed get rejected. And getting rejected is nothing to be afraid of because no one cares about you being rejected except you. And even in the case of rejection, you will learn something. I think the book really demonstrates the point that the most important thing to succeed in anything you want to do is being yourself and not being afraid of anything.

For first dates specifically, I find it best to arrange to meet as soon as possible over chatting in text. You will know a lot more about each other in a brief 10 min conversation together over coffee than anything else. For services like Tinder where you get to chat when both of you 'swiped on each other', it can be as simple as saying 'Let's grab a ☕️ together'

Personally I found dating apps like Tinder to be a [waste of time](https://twitter.com/devonzuegel/status/1087575749949673472). And I like to approach girls I find attractive in real life (where appropriate) by saying hey and asking for their name.

## Notes

- It is better to exchange Instagram accounts with girls you've approached than trying to share phone numbers.
- The best dates you can go to are ones where you can easily share a conversation together.
- [“Nice” is subjective. Typically, the guys who consider themselves the “nice guy” are the ones who do what they think is nice with an added contingency, as if buying a meal or being a normal human being means they deserve affection and adoration from a girl. Nice guys don’t finish last, disingenuous guys do. The douche bags get girls because they do what they want, not what they think the girl wants. Moral of the story: be genuine and be your own human being, not what you think people want or expect you to be.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/99uixo/nice_guys_finish_last/)
- [Enjoy yourself while talking, don’t make it your goal to please her, but to enjoy yourself.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/99yal5/guys_any_tips_on_how_to_flirt_with_a_girl/)
- [Some women will spend hours getting ready before they go out. If you compliment their style and how they've put themselves together it validates all of that work and goes a lot further than just saying some variation of "you're beautiful".](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/99yal5/guys_any_tips_on_how_to_flirt_with_a_girl/)
- [Consuming information but NOT approaching women?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqDFncK-hJE)
- [It’s hard because you have to get comfortable with being vulnerable. You have to be open to the chance of getting hurt. Be okay with putting your all out there and getting nothing in return. You have to love who you really are enough to know that regardless of whether the person you’re trying to open up to accepts you or not, you’re still the same complete you either way.](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/9wv6v5/how_modern_dating_feels/e9nlnmt/?utm_content=permalink)
- [Strong eye-contact, slow movements and masculine body language.](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/9zgplp/how_to_give_off_a_sexual_vibe/)
  - What this guy means by masculine body language is essentially leading and taking control physically. Touch her arms, hold her hands and lightly rub them with your thumbs, twiddle around with her fingers. This works incredibly well if you’re sitting across a table from her. If you’re beside her like at a bar, keep her in your frame. Turn your legs toward her so that if she were to move forward she’d be between them. Again touching her arms, don’t be aggressive! Move closer to her, whisper in her ear. Hold her close, have your arm around her. Those have worked really well in my experience. That’s just a few of many possible ways to show her “hey, I like you more than someone who just wants to be your friend.”
- Once your body starts to act masculine, your mind will soon soon follow.
- [Masculine body language - Take up space, don't slouch, don't sit like a chick with your knees together. Don't twitch, be non-reactive. Imagine a lion: he doesn't give a shit about what's going on around him. He's always relaxed with his head up.](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/9zgplp/how_to_give_off_a_sexual_vibe/)
- [The difference between creepy or not, is how attractive you are (which is determined by everything else you're doing).](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/9zgplp/how_to_give_off_a_sexual_vibe/)
  - Just be unflinching during conversation. General rule of thumb for any interaction is to look at their eyes long enough to realise their eye colour (bit longer if your flirting), look away, then back again rinse and repeat. Another tactic for flirting, is using the triangle: left eye, right eye, lips, repeat. Looking at their lips implies you want to kiss them. Use that when you have more rapport.
  - One exercise you can use: If you spot a girl you like, look at her. If she looks your way, make brief eye contact, look away for a moment, then back again. If she's still looking at you, its a good chance she wants you to talk to her. Girls are pretty persistent in getting attention from guys they like.
  - If she's not looking, its a good chance she's not interested. Don't stare at her. Move on.
- Eye-contact is fundamental. When you look a woman in the eye, don't hide the fact that you want her. Maintain eye-contact. This is a very clear signal you are interested in a woman sexually.
  - Just for clarity. When you make eye contact you need to choose an eye. You can't oscillate back and forth between them. And when he says "maintain eye contact" it doesn't mean blankly stare into her eyes uninterrupted. It means when you do look at her, look into her eyes. Not just at her face. And hold that eye contact slightly longer than you would regularly with other people.

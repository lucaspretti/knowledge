# [Dendrite](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite)

Dendrite is Matrix homeserver written in Go.

It is a rewrite of [synapse](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse) that was written in Python which could not scale.

## Notes

- You don't need to run Kafka unless working on distributed stuff.
- Dendrite is composed of several microservices (room server, sync api, media api...).
  - Kafka is used to transfer messages between those microservices.

# Static sites

I love using [Hugo](hugo.md) for generating static websites. I then use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to host the sites for free.

## Interesting generators

- [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) - Using React.
- [VuePress](https://github.com/vuejs/vuepress) - Minimalistic docs generator with Vue component based layout system.
- [zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola) - Fast static site generator in a single binary with everything built-in.
- [Styx](https://styx-static.github.io/styx-site/) - Purely functional static site generator in Nix expression language.

# [Stylish](https://userstyles.org) themes

I prefer to use dark interfaces on websites. I use [Cascadea](https://cascadea.app) Safari Extension to change the looks of the sites I use to have darker colors in cases where sites don't have them as default. The extension also lets you import any of [Stylish themes](https://userstyles.org) to it. Here is a [download of all the Cascadea styles I use](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dcnhujryt0ydft5/Cascadea%20Styles.sdb?dl=1). For sites that I don't modify with Cascadea, I also run [Dark Reader](https://darkreader.org/) extension which automatically turns all websites dark and does quite a good job at that.

I use Chrome only for webdev and I use [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus#readme) there instead of Stylish as the latter [collects websites you visit](https://robertheaton.com/2018/07/02/stylish-browser-extension-steals-your-internet-history/).

Below are themes I like using:

Although I prefer reading wiki with [Dictionary app](https://wokabulary.com/blog/the-built-in-dictionary-on-mac-and-iphone.html) with its dark mode.

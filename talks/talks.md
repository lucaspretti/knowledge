# Talks

I love watching interesting talks on various subjects. I also love making talks and presenting in front of people.

I once made TEDx talk on mindfulness. I only have a transcript of it [here](http://telegra.ph/TED-Talk---Mindfulness-March-2016-03-28). I hope to give more talks of my own soon.

I mark talks that I found interesting [here](https://github.com/learn-anything/talks#readme).

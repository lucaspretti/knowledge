# [Zsh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell)

My shell of choice. My config for it can be seen [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/dotfiles/tree/master/zsh).

## Notes

- Exported variables get passed on to child processes. Non-exported variables do not.
- I don't need to add `function` text before function definition.
- Search `zshall` man page to find all zsh widgets and more things.
- I can use `zsh/zprof` to profile zsh startup time. Docs for it can be seen in `zshmodules`.

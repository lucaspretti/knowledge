# Evolution

## Notes

- [If you work with any kind of evolutionary system or neural networks or meta-optimizers (Like Schmidhuber's GÃ¶del machine) there comes a point when you realize that "intelligence", whatever it is, should be expected to arise. Evolution and meta-evolution proceed at the same time in life, so intelligence should be ambient in Nature.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18709749)

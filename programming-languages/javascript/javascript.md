# [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/bm/docs/Web/JavaScript)

## Notes

- [You can define and run the function straight away by enclosing it in parenthesis and adding empty () after](https://forum.keyboardmaestro.com/t/javascript-assistance/8331/2)
- In JavaScript, a type is a runtime tag describing the actual kind of data you have at runtime.
- A property is any value attached to an object. A method is a property that is a function.
- `this`, always references the owner of the function it is in, for this case — since it is now out of scope — the window/global object.

# Streaming

I am thinking of starting streaming some of the things I am doing like programming but maybe some other things in the future too.

Both [Twitch](https://go.twitch.tv) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) are great platforms for that.

Here are tools I use for streaming:

1. [OBS](https://obsproject.com) for recording my laptop, audio and sometimes the camera.
2. [iShowU](https://shinywhitebox.com/ishowu) for installing the audio driver so the stream actually captures the sound from my headphones.

## Notes

- To see Twitch chats in IRC, first [connect to Twitch via IRC](https://help.twitch.tv/customer/portal/articles/1302780-twitch-irc), then join the channel of stream you want (i.e. `/join #nikitav`).

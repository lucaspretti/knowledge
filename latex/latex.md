# [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)

LaTeX is an amazing typesetting language that I mostly use to markup various mathematical formulas. I am currently learning more about it and try to use it here in the wiki too with [KaTex](https://plugins.gitbook.com/plugin/katex) plugin.

For writing LaTeX I use [VS Code](../text-editors/vs-code/vs-code.md) and [LaTeX workshop](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop) plugin.

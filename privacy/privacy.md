# Privacy

I try to be aware of my digital fingerprint on the Internet. Who owns the data I create and the data traces I leave.

I made a [repository](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/privacy-respecting#readme) to share all the various alternatives to popular often centralized and _free_ services that are available. And I wrote an [article](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/like-a-dog-on-a-leash-c0cdb8839079) with some of my thoughts on the matter.

I use [Hosts](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts#readme) and [Wipr](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/wipr/id1320666476?l=en&mt=12) for both mac & iOS to limit tracking.

And I have deep interest in [Differential privacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy) and [Homomorphic encryption](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption).

## Notes

- [Facebook is not a private nor a secure platform for sharing sensitive information. Every character that you type into their text boxes is immediately parsed and sent to their servers, regardless of whether you actually complete a post and submit it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/79x7u3/facebook_employees_just_opened_a_privately_shared/)
- Marketing most importantly is about establishing wants that you didn't have.

It doesn’t only hide ads, it blocks the connection between your network and the domains you blacklist completely. You set the IP of your Raspberry Pi running Pihole as your DNS server and that’s it. It comes preconfigured with a lot of blacklisted domains, but there are tons of lists you can add to block even more.

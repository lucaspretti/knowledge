# Networking

This [article](https://drewdevault.com/2016/12/06/A-broad-intro-to-networking.html) is great intro.

## Notes

- `127.0.0.1` is localhost.
- Can go to `Network` tab to see details about requests and why they failed if they did fail. Can view headers etc
- Web browsers will try to connect over port 80 by default.

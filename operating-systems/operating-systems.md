# Operating systems

I love using [macOS](../macOS/macOS.md) as my personal OS.

And I really like [NixOS](linux/nixos.md) and it's [nix package manager](../package-managers/nix/nix.md).

## Interesting OSes

- [MirageOS](https://github.com/mirage/mirage) - Library operating system that constructs unikernels.
- [QubesOS](https://www.qubes-os.org/)
- [Plan 9](https://9p.io/plan9/)
- [Toddler](https://github.com/zhengruohuang/toddler) - Well-designed usable and portable microkernel OS.
- [OS67](https://github.com/SilverRainZ/OS67) - Unix-like toy kernel.
- [Serenity](https://github.com/awesomekling/serenity) - X86 Unix-like operating system for IBM PC-compatibles.

# Aging

Aging is a disease and thus can potentially be cured. For example, [Turritopsis dohrnii](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turritopsis_dohrnii) jelly fish ages backwards.

## Notes

- [Curcumin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curcumin), [Pterostilbene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pterostilbene) and [Nicotinamide riboside](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_riboside) supposedly have anti aging properties.

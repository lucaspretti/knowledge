# Competitive programming

## Notes

- DP’s secret: think globally optimal, not just locally.
  - You have to break the problem into simpler subproblems, solving each of them just once, and building the solution combining these solved subproblems
- The opposite of DP is a greedy algorithm because the latter picks the locally optimal choice at each step. And locally optimal choices may result in a bad global solution.

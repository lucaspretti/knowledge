## Notes

- [Buddhism is a fantastic system that is internally consistent and to our ability to prove it, accurate. Its primary axiom is that life as we know it is suffering, and builds a case for a universe from there that is primarily mental. It is from these observations, not pleas of faith, that the metaphysic is built up rather rationally. It behaves more like a science in many respects, with religious trappings that confuse the westerner. For example, one of the main tenets being skepticism: if you cannot prove what the Buddha stated then reject the model.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RationalPsychonaut/comments/7uefxp/trying_to_find_a_rational_metaphysical_perspective/)
- [The Hindu perspective is that All is a reflection of God, and that we are all facets of this one divinity](https://www.reddit.com/r/entheogens/comments/7oyz6i/where_is_god_in_the_entheogenic_movement_james/)
- [In Buddhism they say that everything is of dependent origin. Watch the mind and notice how everything it does, thinks, remembers, plans, etc is all conditioned. If it is all just conditioning unfolding, then who is thinking? Who is moving the body? Who is making choices?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/55y5p3/has_anyone_here_ever_reached_enlightenment/)

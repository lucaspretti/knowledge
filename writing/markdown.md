# Markdown

Markdown is amazing and such an awesome way to format the text you write. I am using most of the features from it where appropriate.

## Notes

- You can use relative paths in markdown links.
- Don't add extra space after heading as it is unnecessary.
- In referencing titles to jump to in readme, lowercase them. **i.e. [Contributing](#contributing)**. Lose the punctuation in the end in the link.

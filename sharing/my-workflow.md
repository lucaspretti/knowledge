# My Workflow

I try to be methodical in working and doing things. And I use the best tools and workflows that work for me to achieve my goals.

## Life

- [Rules](../focusing/rules.md) - Grounds me into focusing on what I find important in life and cutting out the waste.
- [Processes](../focusing/processes.md) - Streamlines doing some tasks.
- [Habits](../focusing/habits.md) - Habits I am working towards and habits I've learned already.

## Code

- [VS Code](../text-editors/vs-code/vs-code.md) - Main editor. Write mostly Go and TypeScript.
- [Sublime Text](../text-editors/sublime-text/sublime-text.md) - GitHub readmes, editing this wiki and quick edits.
- [Neovim](../text-editors/vim/vim.md) - Edit my [Karabiner](../macOS/apps/karabiner/karabiner.md) config with it and quick edits.

## Task tracking

- [2Do](../macOS/apps/2do.md) - Personal day-to-day tasks. Every task is actionable.
- [Trello](../macOS/apps/trello.md) - Public and personal boards used for different projects centered around my one [Focus](../focusing/focusing.md) board.

## Time management

- [Fantastical](../macOS/apps/fantastical.md) - I plan events in advance for entire day ahead and my day is primarily guided by these events. I use **Week** view with **5 days** from current day shown in the app. This gives me a perspective on what deadlines I have soon to complete and I can adjust my events as necessary and plan accordingly.
- [Timing](../macOS/apps/timing.md) - Track all time I spend there. I automate as much of the tracking as possible so Timing learns from what I do and it's easy to fill out the sections after.

## Knowledge Indexing

- [This wiki](../readme.md) - A bunch of markdown files rendered by [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com) and edited with Sublime Text.
- Articles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev) - Share longer articles on some one topic there. This wiki is a more living and ever changing document.
- [SnippetsLab](https://www.renfei.org/snippets-lab/) - Snippets of code shared with [GitHub Gists](my-gists.md).

## Bookmarks

- [Curated lists](https://github.com/learn-anything/curated-lists#readme) - Extension to [Awesome lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome#readme), serves as a way to publicly curate valuable links on different topics and [search them](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-learn-anything). Any change I make to the lists are automatically committed with [Hazel](../macOS/apps/hazel.md).
- [Alfred My Mind](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-my-mind#readme) - All my public facing bookmarks. Searching this wiki here. Searching my articles, my GitHub repos and more.
- [Safari](../web/browsers/safari.md) - Only contains personal bookmarks I search with [Safari Assistant](https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-safari-assistant). The rest is publicly available and queryable by anyone.

## Photographs

- [Pixave](../macOS/apps/pixave.md) - My entire media library of images and GIFs neatly sorted into collections. I post some images from there to my [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/prettiways/).
- Apple Photos - All my personal photographs and images I made.

## Journaling

- [Day One](../macOS/apps/day-one.md) - All my private memories lie there. It also gets information from my Instagram/Twitter pages so I have nearly everything stored in one place which makes `On This Day` feature awesome.
- [Looking back](../looking-back/looking-back.md) - My public log of things I've done and worked on throughout the months with highlights from each month/year.

## Devices

- Macbook - Everything productive. Code, learn, create.
- iPhone - Communication, podcasts, read, pure consumption.
- iPad - Draw. Read.

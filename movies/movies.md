# Movies

I love watching interesting movies and I saw [a few of them](https://letterboxd.com/nikitavoloboev/films/) thus far.

I love [making lists](https://letterboxd.com/nikitavoloboev/lists/) of movies I've seen and liked. Like a list of my [favorite movies](https://letterboxd.com/nikitavoloboev/list/favorite) or a list of my [favorite movie directors](https://letterboxd.com/nikitavoloboev/list/favorite-directors/) alongside my favorite movies from them.

I have a [Watchlist](https://letterboxd.com/nikitavoloboev/watchlist/) of movies I want to watch.

And here are some [lists](https://letterboxd.com/nikitavoloboev/likes/lists/), [films](https://letterboxd.com/nikitavoloboev/likes/films/) and [reviews](https://letterboxd.com/nikitavoloboev/likes/reviews/) I liked.

# [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb)

## Notes

- Each item has a unique primary key and any number of attributes.
- Scanning for an item means looking through **every item in a table** thus it is less efficient than query search.
- Table is a collection of items, and each item is a collection of attributes.

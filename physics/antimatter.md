## Notes

- [Q: Why haven’t we been able to see the spectra of anti-hydrogen until recently? Why is it so hard to study anti-matter?](http://www.askamathematician.com/2017/03/q-why-havent-we-been-able-to-see-the-spectra-of-anti-hydrogen-until-recently-why-is-it-so-hard-to-study-anti-matter/)
  - The problem with anti-matter is that you can’t let it touch anything.
- I always wonder why photon is its own anti matter. If it was not so, we wouldn't be able to study anti matter with lasers for example.

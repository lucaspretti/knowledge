## Notes

- [The things you are doing aren’t because of cannabis. I can do those things sober. It’s the surrendering that’s doing it. It’s the being still, silent and surrendering. You are pulling your consciousness away from the world and into your own awareness and body. Cannabis puts the feedback of your consciousness on blast so it’s easier to do, but in no way do you need it. It’s just things are more subtle when you are sober.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/8bdt36/how_to_use_cannabis_as_a_very_potent_psychedelic/)
  - The thing so many people don’t realize about astral projection or deep states of consciousness is that it requires subtlety, immense subtlety. Cannabis helps that by amplifying the feedback so you can navigate your own consciousness easier.

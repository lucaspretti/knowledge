## Notes

- [High dose of DMT. It'll be the closest thing to death without actually dying. What you realize is, on the other side of that threshold, a core piece of you will persist. Death is an illusion, consciousness exists forever/outside of time.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/7sec24/does_any_psychedelic_allow_you_to_make_peace_with/)
  - I think, to your point, all entheogens will help you (if you're ready for them), but a full fledged high blast of DMT, to quote Terrance McKenna, "is the farthest out one can go and still come back."
- [DMT is a funny drug, the more you take of it, the easier the trip becomes. It's these mid-range doses that are the worst. Reality is partially slipping away, and your ego, doing its job, is trying hard to grab a hold of what's left of it. You end up with a very anxious ego that thinks its about to die and a terrible trip.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/7zqb5i/anyone_else_got_traumatized/)
- DMT refers specifically to dimethyltryptamine, a tryptamine molecule with two methyl groups on the N position. 5-MeO-DMT shares the same methyl groups but has an additional methoxy group on the 5 position creating an entirely different substance. It is not DMT.
- [It’s all in your mind. Notice how you said that as soon as you remember that things can turn bad they do. It’s because you literally just created that experience by focusing on it. That’s how amazing and powerful you truly are. Everything and everyone you meet on dmt is ultimately you, reflecting back to yourself. You can’t really “think of nothing” because that means you’re trying to control the experience. Simply surrender to whatever happens, if you feel scared then just let the feeling be. Observe it. That’s what it means to become a true psychonaut. Once you get passed that stage then you can go deeper into the experiences and pick up more information.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/89mmsl/scared_of_dmt/)
- [I too had a similar "you are so lucky message." Except mine was more "everything is okay, you're doing fine."and "appreciate this life you live."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/5zimh9/first_dmt_experience_i_wasnt_ready/deyx02z/)
- [We're here because we decided to be. DMT gives you a glimpse of the other side, of the world we come from before birth and go to after death. We choose to put on the mask of ego in order to forget the fact that we already know everything. You now know more than most, having peeled back the skin of reality before it was time to. You'll gradually forget over time. Time heals the ego.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/8ic954/my_mind_wants_to_forget_that_i_did_dmt/)
  - So don't worry, you'll be fine. But take what you've learned and use it to live a good and fulfilling life with the time you have left. Once you pop out the other side, you'll probably decide to come back and be born as something anew. You'll do it to escape the boredom of knowing all. So don't take it so seriously my man. Enjoy yourself, you chose to be here.
- [I’m starting to feel like the vastness of DMT, and the potential that it is truly a gateway to another, real dimension, should leave you feeling a new level of humility and gratitude to simply be alive and able to have these incredible experiences. To be able to peek behind the curtain so to speak, is truly an honor, which is my main takeaway from DMT.... and let’s face it, it’s a hell of a lot of fun too! I don’t think we should discount the fun factor. It doesn’t always have to be so earth-shatteringly serious and heavy.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/8j3syx/anyone_else_feels_that_the_dmt_experience_is_so/)
- [I don't think it's a coincidence most "DMT Waiting Room" images involve a toroidal field.](https://www.reddit.com/r/holofractal/comments/8t9zkf/i_dont_think_its_a_coincidence_most_dmt_waiting/)
- [Even though every DMT trip is different, I feel that every time I do it I come back to the same conclusion. That I am simply an illusion. When I had my breakthrough, thats what it's like when the illusion of self ends. Except when you die for real you don't have a body to come back to. That is what the DMT experience always tells me: That it's all an illusion.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/93od26/advice_for_people_who_want_to_try_dmt/)
- [Meditate for a few minutes. Let yourself know you will be ok, because you will. It will not physically harm you. Whatever you get out of it, don’t take it too seriously, but don’t completely ignore it either. Understand that it is only a few minutes and you will come back. Most likely when you do come back, you’ll probably want to go right back in.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/9fmxf6/i_cannot_physically_make_myself_consume_dmt/)
  - Don’t have any expectations. Take your hit, lay back, smile, and submit. Tell it to take you, and you’ll probably have a good experience.
  - Or don’t do it at all. If your anxiety outweighs your curiosity, then don’t do it. Hang onto it and maybe a day comes when you feel ready. It’s not something you have to do.
- [Here's a tip for the Yocan Evolve Plus. I've been using it for several weeks now with great success, but you need to make sure you are hitting it correctly. First off, after you load the spice, with the cap off, hold the button down for a second or less to melt the deems into a liquid. You'll see it melt. If it doesn't melt down poke it with the small tool and tap the button again for less than a second. The reason you're doing this, is because if it's all fluffy and powdery, when you hit it you'll just inhale the physical crystals. It doesn't have to be completely melted, but it should be gooey gooey so you don't suck it in. Now, when you actually hit it, inhale long and slow. Let a little air in around the sides of your mouth kind of like using your mouth as a carb. You need to inhale slowly and get your lungs completely filled way down deep in your diaphragm. If you hit it like a cigarette, by pulling with your mouth and only filling the upper part of your lungs, it won't work. Try again with these long deep poles letting in little bits of oxygen so you can fill your lungs, and I'm almost positive you'll be able to break through. That being said, I usually still hit it at least twice. On the second and third pull, though, you're actually going to be burning some of the residue, which will produce kind of a white smoke when you exhale. I don't know how much deems is left in that residue, but I do think it's still psychoactive. As such, like I said, I usually make sure I take that second hit just so I'm being efficient.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/apkopg/did_40mg_didnt_breakthrough_questions/)
- [Yocan evolve with ceramic donut coils is fool-proof. Load your dose into the bucket, pulse button to melt, screw on cap, take one long slow drag and you're in hyperspace.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/aeanza/i_know_nothing_at_all_about_vaping_and_i_mean/)
- Load 20 to 30 or 50mg. That's up to you of course, place in the center of the donut coil. Hold the heat button down for 5 seconds. This is my first step, this heats up all of my powder before I inhale. Now holding the vaporizer completely vertical, hold the power button while inhaling 10 to 15 seconds. hold the vapor in your lungs as long as you can, none of that 10-second nonsense. That's all you need to do.
- [Its all in the technique. For one, you have to hold it for much longer than you think. Seriously, like 10-15 seconds per hit. Its a long time! But it absorbs quite slowly into the lungs compared to other drugs.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/8da3lv/disappointing_first_trip/)
- [The best way is with the ceramic donut coil. Put the dmt in and pulse the yocan until the dmt melts and goes under the ring. Then the cap and top back on and pulse the yocan while breathing in. 3 seconds on the button 1 off.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/apy1qf/what_is_the_proper_way_to_vape_dmt_in_a_yocan/)
- [Clean the coil, then do the press test and see if the coil you are using starts glowing red in a decent amount of time. The coil is either getting way to hot and burning your spice (if you taste it a lot its burning) or its just slowly cooking it at too low of a temperature and the heat you are feeling is from the battery.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/9lcaw5/dmt_how_are_you_supposed_to_use_the_yocan_evolve/)
  - My method: melt the spice onto the coil, hold for three seconds then start to draw while releasing the button for one second. repeat the 3 seconds on 1 second off until you are done.
- You don't need to wait for it to melt. As soon as you put the powder on the coils, before you even screw the mouthpiece or cap back on, just tap the button a few times and you can see the stuff melt into a liquid. Just make sure it's all liquid before you put the mouthpiece back on. You don't need the inner cap for this. It just makes it harder to get good airflow.
  - As for taking a hit, as soon as it's all liquid, as soon as you hold down the button it will start to vaporize. So take a firm but gentle hit. Inhale to about halfway lung capacity, and then let go of the button and hit it hard to clear the chamber and cooldown leftover DMT while drawing cool air into your lungs. hold it for as long as you possibly can, the longer the better.
  - You do not need to worry about breathing, your body will automatically regulate that for you in most cases. Unless you have a medical condition. So just don't even worry about it, just hold it as long as you possibly can cuz your body will force you to breathe when it gets too hard
- [Yocan Evolve works. The key is to preheat the pen a bit before loading it with DMT.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/apmc92/dmt_with_yocan_evolve/)
- [If you have a yocan you don't need vape juice. Yocans are for dabs but you can sprinkle dmt (or 5meodmt or crack or meth or several drugs really) straight into the coil. All you need to do is put 50 mg onto the coil and press the button for a second or two until the dmt becomes waxy and stuck to the coil. Then you put the top on and inhale slow and deep for 10 seconds and hold the vapor in for 10 more seconds. That should work. I prepare my lungs and calm my anxiety by breathing in for 10 seconds and holding breathes 10 seconds a few times before I do it. I use a yocan evolve and it's very efficient. If you inhale and hold 50 mg in for the full time you should have a guaranteed breakthrough. The vapor is harsh tho. I always recommend people breakthrough their first time because people generally have the least anxiety and they can get the full experience and because when you ego death you let go and pretty much cannot freak out.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/9lz7ym/could_i_get_a_comprehensive_smoking_guide_im/)
- [Hold for 20 secs. When you breath out nothing should come out.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/aofek1/whats_the_most_fool_proof_method_for_a/)
- For smoking changa with pipe: [Pack the pipe loosely, exhale completely, lightly inhale while gently getting the top completely lit then take the biggest inhale you can and hold as long as you can, repeat.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/a0d9tn/how_to_smoke_changa_with_a_pipe/)
- [I highly suggest using a water bong. It's almost impossible to burn the spice (dunno why, but I haven't been able to), VERY easy on the lungs, and almost every try is a breakthough (with the right dosage).](https://www.dmt-nexus.me/forum/default.aspx?g=posts&m=76437)
  - I double up the screen in the bowl, add leaf (usually blue lotus, but anything will work) put my 40-60mgs of spice on top and then add another thin layer of leaf so that no spice is exposed. Light the top layer and the spice partially vaporizes and the rest melts into the lower bed of leaf. This works wonderful for me.
  - I've made a lot of enhance leaf over the years, but really find that I prefer the leaf bed method.
- For bong with changa: [I'd honestly recommend keeping it at a distance for a second or two to help the DMT melt into the herb a little, and then let it touch to allow the herbs to combust and release their intended MAOI effect](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/97iinn/best_way_to_smoke_changa/)
- [Once the changa is lit, you should take the lighter away and keep sucking. This will help prevent it from burning.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/5oz389/how_to_smoke_change_with_a_pipe/)
- [DMT's existence in people, animals, plants, and so on, really isn't that surprising at all. Lots of molecules exist in biological creatures that serve no necessary purpose, but are there merely because they are the unintentional enzymatic products of other essential compounds in the body. DMT is directly derived from Tryptophan, which exists in pretty much all biological life, and is just a few enzymatic transformations away from DMT.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RationalPsychonaut/comments/b3v4fc/why_are_many_dmt_users_fixated_on_the_possibility/)

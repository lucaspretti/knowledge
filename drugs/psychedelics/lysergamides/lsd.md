## Notes

- [Whenever I do LSD I always get a god complex with a feeling of this reality isn't the REAL reality. Like for instance if consciousness doesn't reside in the human brain and our body just acts as like a receiver for consciousness while the real you lives somewhere in hyperspace or another dimension like a spiritual place. Then in this place you are a God and you can create anything you want, so you make a world where you have lots of money, fame, cars, women, and anything else you've ever wanted. You'd do that for who knows how long and then you'd get bored, right? So then you'd go "alright, what if I make a world and insert myself in it with an unknown & random body, ego, and self and forget that I'm actually God." Thus how you were born on the planet earth, that you created for yourself.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/86j4fz/what_are_some_messed_up_realityshattering/)

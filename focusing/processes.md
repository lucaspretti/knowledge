# Processes

Some simple processes to follow when doing things.

## Learn

1. Find what I want/need to learn. Ideally in context of a problem I want to solve.
2. Read about it on wiki. Find the topic on [Learn Anything](../ideas/learn-anything.md) and learn from best resources for deeper knowledge.
3. Ask myself why it is the way it is. Ask myself what am I missing and what I don't understand (tackle each dependency one by one).

## Write an article

1. Write down main ideas I want to cover as bullet points.
2. Write the article touching on all the main points.
3. Refactor. Remove useless words and irrelevant pieces.
4. Publish.

## Write a book

1. Know what I want to write about. Write an outline.
2. Write the book. Refactor continuously.
3. Publish.

## Read books

1. Read the book. Highlight important parts and/or translate them to wiki as notes.
2. When finished reading, transfer highlights to wiki. Make review of book on Goodreads.

## Make Alfred workflow

1. Follow [making workflows outline](../macOS/apps/alfred/making-workflows.md).
2. Share it. Post the workflow on [Alfred Forum](https://www.alfredforum.com/). Heading (36 pt), `Code | Download` (22 pt) on the bottom. [Example](https://www.alfredforum.com/topic/10486-ask-create-share).

# Habits

I use [Streaks](https://streaksapp.com) iOS app to track any new habits I want to add to my life. If any of the habits get 100 consecutive repetitions, I mark the habit as `learned` and focus on new habits I want to add to my life.

I also keep top habits/[rules](rules.md) I try to follow through in life on display in my [Focus board](focusing.md).

## Morning routine

I use [Siri Shortcuts](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-ios#shortcuts) for my Morning and Night routines.

## Notes

- I think learning how to break habits is actually a very important meta skill and can serve you in life almost better than anything else.

# [GitHub](https://github.com)

I ðŸ’š GitHub. It is one of the best communities out there that exists with so many different projects and ideas being worked on at any given time.

I publish most of my work and make it open source for other people to use and reuse.

[Here](../sharing/my-github.md) you can find all the repositories I shared.

## Notes

- You can append `#readme` to GitHub repo URL to jump to the README of the repo. I use it all the time for curated lists of any kind and where README is the most important thing in the repo.
- Selecting some text in a GitHub comment and pressing `r` will make a reply of that text.
- [GitHub jump](https://github.com/lox/alfred-github-jump) workflow is one of the best things you can install to navigate GitHub like a God.
  - I [slightly modified it](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows#workflow-augmentations) to jump to different parts of the repo with modifiers like going to issues, releases, opening new issue or even cloning the repo instantly.
- I can include media files like GIFs in the repository itself and then just reference them from readme to embed them.
- I can include and mix in HTML in GitHub readme's. This is super useful for embedding images because you can customize `width` and `height` values to make the READMEs look a lot nice.
- I can tack in various GitHub related templates like `issue_template.md` and `pull_request_template.md` as well as `code_of_conduct.md` and even `contributing.md` under `.github` folder at the root of my project.
